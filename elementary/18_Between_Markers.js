/* You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions:

The initial and final markers are always different.
If there is no initial marker, then the first character should be considered the beginning of a string.
If there is no final marker, then the last character should be considered the ending of a string.
If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole string.
If the final marker comes before the initial marker, then return an empty string. */
